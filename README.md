# Hello World for NAO6
This is a Hello World program that can be run on the NAO6 robot. It provides basic functions for robot movement and speech.

When the program is run, the NAO will stand, wave and say "Hello, World!", and sit back down.

Make sure the NAO is in a sitting position prior to running the program!
